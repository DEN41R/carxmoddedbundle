echo [2] TROUBLESHOOTING
echo ===================
echo.
echo 1. What should I do if my game doesn't load after 28?%
echo The answer is that your save file has stuff from version 1.9. Use the save file from the modpack using method 3.
echo.
echo 2. The game does not load beyond 64%
echo The answer is that you have not migrated the Catalog.json in the right place
echo.

echo 2. Invisible parts for each machine
echo 3. Free cars at the dealership and without DLC or event type requirements
