        CarX Street 1.6.0 Modpack Tutorial


[1] INSTALLATION
================

1. Install the 1.6.0 version of the game:
   - Open Steam
   - Press Win+R
   - Type: steam://open/console
   - In console paste this command:
     download_depot 1114150 1114151 6995232317792283507

2. Copy these files to your game folder:
   - Catalog to: \CarX Street_Data\StreamingAssets\aa
   - 47c bundle to: \CarX Street_Data\StreamingAssets\aa\StandaloneWindows64

3. [OPTIONAL] Save file location:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\YOUR_STEAM_ID\1114150\remote

[2] TROUBLESHOOTING
===================

1. What should I do if my game doesn't load after 28?
The answer is that your save file has stuff from version 1.9. Use the save file from the modpack using method 3.

2. The game does not load beyond 64
The answer is that you have not migrated the Catalog.json in the right place

[3] MODPACK FEATURES
====================

1. Ready-made files for the game
2. Invisible parts for each machine
3. Free cars at the dealership and without DLC or event type requirements
4. The ability to change the characteristics of cars more than the game allows
5. You can also now modify the file if necessary or ask me.

            Enjoy your game!
